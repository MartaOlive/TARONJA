# TAPIS: Tables from APIs for Sensors. An STAplus Explorer
A Javascript code that builds queries and explore the STAplus content, saves it as CSV or GeoJSON and connects with the [MiraMon Map Browser](https://github.com/grumets/MiraMonMapBrowser) 

While the project is completely independent from the [Orange data mining](https://orangedatamining.com/) software, it has been inspired by its GUI. The general idea of the application is to be able to work with STA data as tables.
